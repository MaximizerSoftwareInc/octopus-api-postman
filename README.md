# Octopus API Postman Collection

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/postman) is an API development tool that allows you to quickly and easily create and execute API requests and examine the responses for web service APIs like OctopusAPI.
It provides a great way to experiment with and learn about the OctopusAPI without having to write a single line of code.

To help you get started with the OctopusAPI, this repository contains a series of Postman collections that provide example requests for the [OctopusAPI](https://www.postman.com/maximizercrm/workspace/maximizer-api/overview).

If you aren't already using Postman, [you can download it here](https://www.getpostman.com/postman). Before getting started with the OctopusAPI collection, take a moment to browse the [introductory Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/), especially the instructions for [how to send your first request](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/) and [how to use collections](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/).

## Getting Started

### Download the Source

Once you have Postman installed on your machine, [click here](https://github.com/MaximizerCRM/octopus-api/archive/master.zip) to download the source for the OctopusAPI collections.

### Create an Environment

In order to use the collections, you will need to [create an Environment in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/) to store your OctopusAPI URL and credentials.

To set up your Postman environment:
1. In the Postman toolbar, click **Import**.
2. Browse to and select the starter environment in the `postman/environments` folder that you downloaded above.
3. Click the "Manage Environments" button (the gear icon in the upper-right corner of the Postman window).
4. Click the name of the "OctopusAPI" environment that you imported.
5. Update the values of each of the environment variables in the list and save your changes. Each of the environment variables and their expected values are described below.

Now you're ready to import a collection and start making requests.

### Import a Collection and Make Your First Request

The collections can be found in the `postman/collections` directory, and are organized by entity type or by related functionality.

To [import a collection into Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats):
1. In the Postman toolbar, click **Import**.
2. Browse to and select the `OctopusAPI.json` collection in the `postman/collections` folder that you downloaded above.
3. Expand the `OctopusAPI` collection and folder in the left panel of Postman.
